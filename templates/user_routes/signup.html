    <h2>Notice to User:</h2>
    <p>
      CampHub uses the Google Blogger API - as a result, authorization from a
      google account is necessary to create an account with CampHub. CampHub
      will not store any personal or private information from your Google
      account. Access is simply authorizing an existing gmail account user to a
      blogger/ CampHub account as required by the API to make comments, posts,
      etc. This authorization will only need to be completed once. Upon clicking
      "Create Account" you will be prompted to authorize a connection between a
      google account and your new CampHub account.
    </p>
    <p>
      CampHub will however store your desired CampHub username and password to
      authenticate you for any future vists.
